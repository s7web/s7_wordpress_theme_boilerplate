  ***You have three options how to include css library:*** 
  1) CDN :
  * if you want to register new css library for ***frontend***, you have to register it in file ``` /functions/themes/theme-style.php```

  * if You want to add new library style in ***dashboard***.

### SCRIPTS: 
 * import all your frontend scripts into ```/assets/js/frontend.js``` and , scripts for dashboard import  into  ```/assets/js/dashboard.js``` file. Those scripts are global.
 * ***load specific script on specific page:***
  
   Create file into the ``` /assets/js/``` folder with prefix ```page-``` and rest of the name will be the same as page link. 

   e.g.
  page url: ```/contact-us```  name of file will be: ```/assets/js/page-contact-us.js```

    All those scripts will be compiled into ```/dist/js/admin-bind.js```  and ```/dist/js/frontend-bind.js``` 

   The function responsible for this functionality:

    ``` /functions/helpers/helpers.php   getScriptByPage(){}```

   ***REGISTER NEW LIBRARIES:***
  *  Frontend:  ``` /functions/admin/admin-script.php```
  *  Dashboard:  ``` /functions/admin/admin-script.php```
